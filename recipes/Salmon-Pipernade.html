    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Piperade is a tomato-pepper sauce spiced with piment d'Espelette from the 
        Basque region, comforting, versatile, and easy to make. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Originating during 
        the 19th century in the French Basque region, the dish's name arose from the Latin word 
        “piper,” meaning black pepper. Summer in the Pyrénées typically brings plentiful, fresh 
        tomatoes and green peppers, making it the perfect time to cook pipérade.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomato concassade</li>
        <li>Cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Skinless red pepper</li>
        <li>White onion</li>
        <li>Fillets of Salmon</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Bay leafs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Tomato puree</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Puncture peppers and roast in 220 C oven for ~ 45 mins. After roasting, place into bowl 
            and cover bowl with clingfilm for ~ 15. Afterwards, proceed to quarter the pepper to 
            remove the skin and ribs and waste the seeds. Save the skin and ribs in a seperate bowl.
        Proceed to juilenne the red pepper.</li>
        <li>Create the tomoto concassade while the red pepper is roasting and dice the tomato petals into small cubes. Save the skin and pulp in the same 
            bowl as the red pepper offcuts.</li>
        <li>Finely slice the onion and garlic into very slim strips. The small thickness will allow for a faster cooking time, thereby
            preserving the freshness of the vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>Create the tomato passate by blending some olive oil, tomato puree, the offcuts of the red pepper and tomatoes with some salt. Pass the passata through
            a fine chieve to remove large solids.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some olive oil up in a pan on a medium-high heat and add the onion to it.
        Continually stir the pan to prevent the onions from colouring.</li>
        <li>As the onions are starting to soften, add the garlic, thyme and bayleafs to the pan and commence the continual stirring.</li>
        <li>Once the water content has evapourated, the onions will soften (Use sight, sound and smell to determine), add the tomato concassade.</li>
        <li>Continually it across the pan so the final product retains freshness.</li>
        <li>If you pull your spatula through the mixture and minimal water seeps out (only olive oil is left) you are ready to proceed.</li>
        <li>Add red peppers and fresh passata. "The working of those peppers with the speed of the cooking retaines the freshness of the ingredients.
            - Whether you're making an imam byoli, a rattatouie it's about the speed. It's not about a slow braise because it all stains and dye's, what you want is that freshness. You want the sunshine flavours of Province."</li>
        <li>Remainder left is to reduce to desired consistency and season. Season with more salt and paprika and reduce mixture.</li>
        <li>Desired consistency: When you pull your spatula through the mixture you want it to slowly ooze back. Check for seasoning and remember to account for the reduction.</li>
        <li>Lastly, we need to cook the salmon steaks. Pour a generous helping of olive oil into pan we nearly want to shallow fry the steaks.</li>
        <li>Heavily season the skin side of the salmon and place steaks into pan by laying them away from you.</li>
        <li>Season the topside and cook on the skin side until skin is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Whilst salmon is cooking, chiffonade the basil and lightly dress in olive oil and salt.</li>
        <li>Flip the salmon to kiss on the flesh side until the meat is cooked to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve by creating a bed of piperade, laying the salmon on top and dressing with the basil.</li>
    </ol>
